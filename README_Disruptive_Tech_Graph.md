# Disruptive Technologies Ontology Graph

This project provides an interactive knowledge graph to explore the hierarchical structure of disruptive technologies, organized into:

- **5 Strategic Nodes** (e.g. Intelligence, Energy)
- **25+ Innovation Cells** (e.g. Edge AI, Fusion Energy)
- **125+ Key Enabling Technologies (KETs)**

The visualization is built with **D3.js** and fully compatible with GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone or upload this repository
If you haven't yet, create a GitHub repository (e.g. `disruptive-tech-graph`) and upload the following files:

- `index.html`
- `Disruptive_Tech_Graph_Nodes.csv`
- `Disruptive_Tech_Graph_Edges.csv`
- `Full_Disruptive_Technologies_Ontology.json` *(optional, for backend/API use)*

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
- Go to your repository **Settings**
- Scroll down to **Pages**
- Under **Source**, select the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder
- Click **Save**
- Your site will be live at:
  ```
  https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/
  ```

## 📊 How to Use

- Strategic nodes are color-coded
- Click and drag nodes to explore
- Zoom and pan enabled

## 🔍 Files

- `index.html`: Main D3.js visualizer
- `Disruptive_Tech_Graph_Nodes.csv`: Nodes with type and label
- `Disruptive_Tech_Graph_Edges.csv`: Directed relationships (edges)
- `Full_Disruptive_Technologies_Ontology.json`: Full structured taxonomy (optional)
